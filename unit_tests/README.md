# Unit Tests

This directory contains CTest unit tests for Alquimia core utilities and ONNX engine behavior.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test_alquimia_c_utils.c` | Tests generic C utility behavior. |
| `test_alquimia_onnx_mapping.c` | Tests ONNX JSON config (**[`onnx_alquimia_config.c`](../alquimia/onnx_alquimia_config.c)**) parsing, mapping validation, metadata (`GetProblemMetadata`), and relative model paths. |
| `test_alquimia_onnx_failures.c` | Tests ONNX (**[`onnx_alquimia_interface.c`](../alquimia/onnx_alquimia_interface.c)**) setup failures (`Setup`), condition-processing guards (`ProcessCondition`), and lifecycle cleanup (`Shutdown`). |
| `test_alquimia_onnx_inference_routing.c` | Tests ONNX (`ReactionStepOperatorSplit`) input/output routing, model-family compatibility, runtime errors, and ALSURF integration. |
| `onnx_test_utils.c` / `onnx_test_utils.h` | Shared ONNX test helpers for setup, shutdown, paths, state allocation, condition setup, inference, diagnostics, and temporary config files. |
| `onnx_test_cases/` | Test JSON configs and small ONNX artifacts used by the ONNX unit tests. For detailed specifications, please refer to **[onnx_test_cases/README.md](onnx_test_cases/README.md).**|

ONNX test IDs are file-local. For example, `E01` in the mapping test is a different issue from `E01` in the routing test.
