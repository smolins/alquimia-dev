Description
-----------

Alquimia provides a generic interface between flow and transport simulators (drivers) and biogeochemical reaction capabilities (engines). Alquimia consists of two parts: an application programming interface, API, and a wrapper library. The API describes in detail how information is exchanged between the driver and the engine. This includes the function call signatures and data structures required for implementing alquimia in a mixed language (C/C++/Fortran) programming environment. The library is an implementation of the documented API, providing an interface into the biogeochemistry routines supplied by other codes: Alquimia does not do any geochemical calculations. Version 1.0 provides interfaces to the open source codes (BSD) CrunchFlow/CrunchTope and (LGPL) PFLOTRAN. Version 1.0 meets the policies set forth by (and is part of) the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit, xSDK version 0.6.0.

Originally developed as part of the DOE ASCEM project, it is now mantained and developed under the 
U.S. Department of Energy's `IDEAS Watersheds <https://ideas-productivity.org/>`_ project

Currently, the geochemical engines suported are `CrunchFlow <https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope-dev>`_ and
`PFLOTRAN <https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran-dev>`_.

Building
--------

You'll need working C and Fortran compilers and CMake installed on your system.
For UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, you'll need GNU Make or another 
capable version of Make installed as well. To build on Windows, you'll need 
some recent version of Visual Studio and a decent Fortran compiler such as 
Intel's.

Required packages and versions
==============================

Currently, to be built, Alquimia requires PETSc and at least one of the two
geochemical engines, either PFLOTRAN or CrunchFlow.

Alquimia is part of the `Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit (xSDK) <https://xsdk.info>`_, 
along with PETSc and PFLOTRAN. xSDK releases ensure that certain version of these
software packages will build together. In addition to the instructions that follow,
note that Alquimia -like the other xSDK packages- may also be built using the
package manager `Spack <https://spack.io>`_. 

To build Alquimia, use the version of the packages in
`the latest release of the xSDK <https://xsdk.info/releases/>`_
to ensure compatibility. Currently:

+------------+------------+
|            | Version    |
+------------+------------+
|xSDK        | 0.7.0      |
+------------+------------+
|Alquimia    | 1.0.9      |
+------------+------------+
|PETSc       | 3.16       |
+------------+------------+
|PFLOTRAN    | 3.0.2      |
+------------+------------+
|CrunchFlow  | dev        |
+------------+------------+

CrunchFlow is currently not part of the xSDK but generally the development
branch in `CrunchFlow <https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope-dev>`_
will work.

PETSc
=====

`PETSc <https://petsc.org>`_ is a suite of data structures and routines for
the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial
differential equations. The PETSc requirement in Alquimia stems from the fact
that both engines, PFLOTRAN or CrunchFlow, require PETSc.

To download and install PETSc, please follow the instructions in
`petsc.org <https://petsc.org>`_ or in
`pflotran.org <http://doc-dev.pflotran.org/user_guide/how_to/installation/installation.html>`_. 
At the end of the installation, the PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH environment variables
must set properly.


PFLOTRAN engine
===============

`PFLOTRAN <https://www.pflotran.org>`_ is an open source, state-of-the-art
massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code. Alquimia provides
access to the geochemical capabilities of PFLOTRAN; more speficically, the
geochemical capabilities available under the operator splitting mode.

Follow the instruction to download and build PFLOTRAN found
`here <http://doc-dev.pflotran.org/user_guide/how_to/installation/installation.html>`_,
Do not build the pflotran target rather pflotran_rxn:

::

    cd $PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran
    make pflotran_rxn

To build PFLOTRAN on Windows, see the instructions 
`here <https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran-dev/wiki/Installation/Windows_with_Visual_Studio>`_.


CrunchFlow engine
=================

`CrunchFlow <https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope-dev>`_
is a powerful software package for simulating reactive transport
developed by Carl Steefel and co-workers and applied since 1988 to a variety
of problems in the earth and environmental sciences. Alquimia provides access
to the geochemical capabilities of CrunchFlow; more speficically, the
geochemical capabilities available under the operator splitting mode.

Download the master branch of CrunchFlow, apply the makefile patch and build
the libcrunchchem.a target: 

::

    cd $CRUNCHFLOW_DIR/source
    git apply MakefileForAlquimia.patch
    make libcrunchchem.a

More detailed instructions for building CrunchFlow will be forthcoming. 

Alquimia interface
==================

When you have built all the desired chemistry engines, you can build the 
Alquimia interface. On UNIX and UNIX-like systems, you can use the following 
command, which assumes you have set ALQUIMIA_DIR to the top of your Alquimia 
source tree. Note that you will need to create a build tree from which to 
invoke CMake.

:: 

    cd $ALQUIMIA_DIR
    mkdir build ; cd build
    cmake .. \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation prefix> \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C compiler> \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ compiler> \
      -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<Fortran compiler> \
      -DXSDK_WITH_PFLOTRAN=ON \
      -DTPL_PFLOTRAN_LIBRARIES=$PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran/libpflotranchem.a \
      -DTPL_PFLOTRAN_INCLUDE_DIRS=$PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran \
      -DXSDK_WITH_CRUNCHFLOW=ON \
      -DTPL_CRUNCHFLOW_LIBRARIES=$CRUNCHFLOW_DIR/libcrunchchem.a \
      -DTPL_CRUNCHFLOW_INCLUDE_DIRS=$CRUNCHFLOW_DIR
    make 

**NOTE**: you can omit either of the engines if you aren't building them both. 
If you don't specify any chemistry engine, Alquimia will halt and remind you 
that building it without an engine is pointless. So, for example, to build 
Alquimia with an install of PFlotran at $PFLOTRAN_DIR using MPI compilers, 
in Debug mode, to be installed in /usr/local:

:: 

    cd $ALQUIMIA_DIR
    mkdir build ; cd build
    cmake .. \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` \
      -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=`which mpif90` \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DXSDK_WITH_PFLOTRAN=ON \
      -DTPL_PFLOTRAN_LIBRARIES=$PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran/libpflotranchem.a \
      -DTPL_PFLOTRAN_INCLUDE_DIRS=$PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran
    make 

If you are using a geochemical engine that requires PETSc, and you want to 
specify the exact locations of its headers, and the method for linking against 
PETSc's libraries, you can specify these with the -DTPL_PETSC_INCLUDE_DIRS=<list of dirs> and 
-DTPL_PETSC_LDFLAGS=<link flags> arguments. Normally, these options are 
omitted and Alquimia automatically detects PETSc's location using the PETSC_DIR
and PETSC_ARCH environment variables.

Testing
-------

To run Alquimia's suite of tests from your build directory, just type

::

    make test

See the CMakeLists.txt file for other available build options, including
optimization level, shared/static libraries, build prefix, etc. Alquimia 
supports all xSDK-compliant build options, which can be passed to CMake 
when configuring your build.

Installation
------------

You can install the Alquimia library and the demo drivers into your desired 
location, type

::

    make install

This will install libraries into ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib, headers into 
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/alquimia, and the demo drivers into 
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin. To run some basic sanity checks on these installed
drivers, you can type

::

    make test_install

This will run a few benchmark tests to make sure that the executables have been 
properly linked and installed.
